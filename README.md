# Description of Module
This is a simple custom module that makes a call to 
the [MBTA API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api) and 
fetches the data and displays the current train routes. 
In the controller file curl commands are using the make a call to the API
and fetch the data. This module is being rewritten using the 
default theme implementation of a table and making a call to
the API using object oriented programming.
