# Description of Module
This is a simple custom module that makes a call to the MBTA API and 
fetches the data and displays the current train routes. This module is currently 
being rewritten to replace the curl commands with the HTTP Client library [Guzzle](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/674/top-7-best-php-http-client-libraries).
